# üñ•Ô∏è Amazon EC2 ‚Äì Elastic Compute Cloud

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is one of the most foundational AWS services. It lets you provision **virtual machines** in the cloud, with flexible configuration, scaling, pricing, and control.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What Does EC2 Offer?

- Launch **virtual servers** (EC2 instances)
- Attach **block storage** (EBS)
- Use **ELB** for traffic distribution
- Enable **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** for horizontal scaling

> üìå EC2 is part of the **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)** model

---

## üí• Burstable Instances ‚Äì T Series

### T2/T3 Overview

- Accumulate **CPU credits**
- Credits consumed when bursting beyond baseline

### T2 Unlimited Mode

- Continue bursting **even when out of credits**
- Pay extra for exceeded usage
- Ideal for workloads with unexpected spikes

---

## üîß EC2 User Data

- Used to **bootstrap** an instance at launch (runs **once only**)
- Runs as **root user**
- Ideal for:
  - Installing packages
  - Running startup scripts
  - Downloading files from the internet

---

## üì° EC2 Meta Data

- Accessible from within the instance:  
  `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`

- Useful to retrieve:
  - Instance ID
  - AMI ID
  - Security Group
  - IAM Role (but not IAM Policy)
  - Public/Private IPs

---

## üîê Security Groups

- Act as **virtual firewalls** for EC2
- Control **inbound/outbound traffic**
- Attached to **ENI**, not the instance directly
- Stateless ‚Üí Must define **both inbound & outbound rules**

---

## üîë Key Pairs

- SSH public/private key pair used to login to EC2
- Generated once during instance launch or externally via AWS Console
- If you lose the private key, you cannot SSH into the instance

---

## üìç Elastic IPs (EIP)

- **Static public IP** for your EC2 instance
- **1 free EIP per region**, but you pay if not associated
- Use case: When you need a persistent public IP across stops/reboots

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Placement Groups

Used for **instance placement strategy** across physical hardware.

| Type       | Behavior                                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cluster    | Same rack for low latency / high throughput networking                   |
| Spread     | Separate hardware ‚Üí Max availability                                     |
| Partition  | Spread across partitions (groups of racks) for fault isolation           |

## üìà EC2 Monitoring

| Type              | Details                                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Basic Monitoring  | Metrics every **5 minutes** (free)          |
| Detailed Monitoring | Metrics every **1 minute** (paid)         |
| Tools             | CloudWatch, CloudTrail, EC2 dashboard       |

---

- Data **persists** after instance stop
- Types:
  - General Purpose (gp3/gp2)
  - Provisioned IOPS (io1/io2)
  - Throughput optimized (st1)
  - Cold HDD (sc1)

### 2. Instance Store

- Ephemeral local storage (physically attached)
- **Data lost** when instance stops or terminates
- Use for:
  - Buffer/cache
  - Temp data

---

## üß± AMI ‚Äì Amazon Machine Image

- **Template** for launching EC2 with pre-installed OS/software
- Public or private
- Custom AMIs useful for:
  - Faster boot
  - Pre-installed dependencies
  - Security and consistency

## üõ°Ô∏è Shared Responsibility Model for EC2

| AWS Manages                                 | You Manage                                    |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Physical hardware, network, hypervisor      | EC2 instance OS, updates, application logic   |
| Data center, storage infrastructure          | Data, security patches, firewall (SG/NACLs)   |
| Hardware security                            | IAM roles, SSH key rotation, monitoring       |

---

## üß† EC2 Key Exam Takeaways

- EC2 = IaaS virtual servers
- Choose right **instance type** and **purchase option**
- Use **Security Groups** and **Key Pairs** for security
- Leverage **User Data** to automate instance setup
- Store persistent data in **EBS**, not Instance Store
- **Elastic IPs** are static IPs, but chargeable when unassociated
- Understand **burstable T2/T3**, AMIs, placement groups
- Watch out for shared responsibility boundaries
