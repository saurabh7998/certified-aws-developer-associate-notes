## üß† S3 vs EBS vs RDS ‚Äì Key Differences

| Feature                  | S3 (Simple Storage Service)                            | EBS (Elastic Block Store)                              | RDS (Relational Database Service)                   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose                  | Object storage for files, backups, static assets       | Block storage for EC2 instances                        | Managed relational database service                 |
| Storage Type             | Object-based                                            | Block-based                                             | Structured (SQL) data storage                     |
| Data Access              | Access via HTTP(S), API, SDK                           | Mounted to an EC2 instance and accessed like a disk     | Accessed via SQL clients or applications           |
| Persistence              | Independent, persists even if EC2 terminates           | Persists beyond EC2 lifecycle unless manually deleted   | Fully managed with automatic backups               |
| Scalability              | Infinitely scalable                                    | Limited by volume size (up to 16 TiB per volume)        | Scales vertically (instance size) or read replicas |
| Use Case Examples        | Static website hosting, data lake, media files         | OS volumes, database files, application storage         | Web apps needing relational DBs (MySQL, PostgreSQL)|
| Availability & Durability| 99.999999999% durability (11 9s), regional redundancy  | Within an AZ (unless using snapshots or replication)    | Multi-AZ for HA, automatic backups and failover    |
| Performance              | High throughput, eventual consistency                  | Low-latency, high IOPS                                  | Depends on instance type and DB engine             |
| Backup/Recovery          | Versioning, lifecycle rules, cross-region replication  | Snapshots and volume cloning                            | Point-in-time recovery, snapshots, multi-AZ        |
| Management               | Fully managed by AWS                                   | User-managed (create/delete volumes)                    | Fully managed (automated patching, backups)        |
| Cost Model               | Pay for storage and requests                           | Pay for provisioned size and IOPS                       | Pay per instance size, storage, and usage          |

## üìù In Simple Words:

* **S3** is like Google Drive ‚Äì store files, media, backups.
* **EBS** is like a hard drive ‚Äì attached to EC2 like your laptop's disk.
* **RDS** is a hosted database ‚Äì you use it like MySQL/Postgres without managing the machine.

If you're learning for the **AWS Developer Associate** exam, remember:

* **S3** = Object storage (event-driven, serverless triggers possible)
* **EBS** = Block storage for EC2 (must be attached to an instance)
* **RDS** = Fully managed SQL database (with options like read replicas, multi-AZ, etc.)
